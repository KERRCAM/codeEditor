TODO
- multiple window separate input (essentially set up manager properly)
- text rendering (will be a lot to this, will probably start simple and improve throughout)
- sort rendering to not wipe per frame, just overwrite as needed (still buffer tho)
- file saving and loading (open navigator)
- terminal integration
- UI for directory files so project can be open
- allow for single instance multiple files open
- add extra general UI (settings, run, git etc)
- code highlighting
- code suggestions (not line auto complete just stuff like variables, functions etc)
- at this point any improvements will be minimal (extra language support, rendering upgrades etc)
  so sort out packaging process
